            Hey!👋 It's *github-actions[bot]* speaking!
            I can build and deploy your application, connect it to a database and object storage, and give you a preview URL.💡
            Send me `/deploy` to deploy a preview with the "dev" environment.
            `/deploy --force` if you want to overwrite the attached DB and storage contents
            `/deploy pp_qa` will use the QA database backup and object storage
            `/rebuild` command rebuilds and deploys a container only, reusing the attached DB and storage.
              Use it to deploy your recently committed code.
            `/run-migration` command will find migrations in the “migrations” folder and apply them if needed.
            `/destroy` command removes a deployment and the attached DB and storage
            You can find the documentation on [Pull request preview CI for huma-server-sdk](https://humatherapeutics.atlassian.net/l/c/6fowL0Xo) in Confluence.
